title: Pentesting Fundamentals
---

This is the first module in TryHackMe's new JR. Penetration Tester learning path. The topics covered in the module include the essential ethics and methodologies that will be used in every pentest. This is an easy level; you will need to read the text to find most of the answers. 

## Task 1: What is penetration testing? 
"A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyze the security defenses to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit."

**Answer**

## Task 2: Penetration Testing Ethics
What are the different hats that a hacker can wear?

- White Hat: The "Good people."
- Grey Hat: Doesn't always follow the law
- Black Hat: The criminals

Rules of Engagement (ROE)
This is a document that is made before any pentesting happens. The document is made up of 3 sections Permission, Test Scope, Rules. 

You are given permission to perform a security audit on an organization; what type of hacker would you be?
**White Hat**

You attack an organization and steal its data. What type of hacker would you be?
**Black Hat**

What document defines how a penetration testing engagement should be carried out?
**Rules of Engagement**

## Task 3: Penetration Testing Methodologies
Stages of a Pentest
- Information Gathering: Finding publicly accessible information
- Enumeration/Scanning: Discover applications and services on a system 
- Exploitation: Use vulnerabilities found 
- Privilege Escalation: Gain access to an account with the same or higher permissions
- Post-exploitation: Pivoting, Information we can gather, covering your tracks, Reporting

What stage of penetration testing involves using publicly available information?
**Information Gathering**

If you wanted to use a framework for pentesting telecommunications, what framework would you use? Note: We're looking for the acronym here and not the full name.
**OSSTMM**

What framework focuses on the testing of web applications?
**OWASP**

## Task 4: Black box, White box, Grey box Penetration testing 
The three primary scopes when testing an application or services. This is the knowledge given to you at the start of the pentest and determines the level of testing you need to perform. 
- Black-Box Testing: No knowledge
- Grey-Box Testing: Partial Knowledge
- White-Box Testing: Full Knowledge

You are asked to test an application but are not given access to its source code - what testing process is this?
**Black box**

You are asked to test a website, and you are given access to the source code - what testing process is this?
**White Box**
